# TopoToolbox - a set of Matlab functions for topographic analysis

## Colormaps

This folder contains a number of colormaps for DEM visualization.
The ttcmap is a function that is particular useful if you want to combine
topography and bathymetry which are usually displayed using different colormaps.

The ttscm is a wrapper function for the library of colormaps developed by 
Fabio Crameri (see [here](http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php).
